    # boost, but comes at the risk of index corruption in an environment where
    # concurrent writes are numerous.

    # If you have multiple processes accessing the same index (Passenger,
    # Mongrels, Unicorn) it is recommended that you leave this as-is.

    # this can safely be set to false. This is the recommended setting for
    # Heroku.
